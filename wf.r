# Our model shows that both regressors tax-exclusive price and tax rates imposed to gasoline
# are statistically significant at all levels.
# The coefficients of the Î²s implies elasticity. From our model's regression,
# we found that both have negative relationship with gasoline consumption per adult.
# However, consumers are relatively inelastic to the change in tax-exclusive price (due to
# change in global oil price). On the other hand, consumers are relatively elastic/responsive to a change
# in gasoline price due to tax levied upon gasoline. This significant difference in terms of
# elasticity is due to the salience of taxation compared to the implicit change in non-tax
# price change.
